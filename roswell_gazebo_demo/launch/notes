Problems hit:
- inconsistent upgrades
- many urdf tweaks
  -- added transmission, but missing one!
  -- added weights, inertia
- geometry box touched ground - not gazebo based
  -- needed to add rear wheel
  -- thought it was the pid again -> not correct

- the arm's linear actuator dropped to the floor
  -- made all the weights and inertia near zero
  -- thought it was the pid again -> not correct
  -- type of controller not supported

- navigation turning and rotating not good
  -- thought it was the pid again -> not correct
  -- reduced speed made ton of difference
  -- friction?

- rotating continues despite zero velocity
  -- thought it was the pid again -> not correct
  -- friction?
  -- reduced speed of rotation, explicitly stop rotation by negligable 
     moving forward 

- point cloud sensor in wrong frame in gazebo, requiring more urdf tweaks
- starting location not quite right (rotate once to get slam to correct)

- lots of interacting parts. All of which change behavior, but not root cause 
  of problem. mu1, mu2, Kp, Kd,...
  Also setting ./roswell_navigation/config/roswell//move_base.yaml params

- Good news: some of the above problems would be my bugs on the real robot, 
  and may have been even harder to debug. Although gazebo introduces 
  non-realworld limitations,
  once you have a working baseline, you can prototype on Gazebo and more quickly 
  move to real robot.

- torsional friction not supported in gazebo until gazabo7. With frequent 
  rotations for moveit recovery, the simulation was unacceptable. Have
  to upgrade to gazebo7, which has its own dependencies... 
  Now upgrading libboost and installing many other dependencies..
 
-  Modified link.text in many ~/catikin/build/gazebo_ros_* directories to
   dynamically link .so versions of boost libriaries: 
   /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_iostreams.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_regex.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_thread.so  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_system.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_filesystem.so 

-  Re-modified many gazebo_row link.text again after gazebo upgrade
   Next time write a script!!!!

- fixed minor gazebo7 incompatibilites with 2.2
