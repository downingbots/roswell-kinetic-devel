Find something in room that you can pick up:
 - pick up, check if within gripper
 - carry over to another location and drop off
 - maximize points per minute:

--------------
Point system:
 - more points for something new or not used for longer time
 - more points for dropping off at a higher location 
   (including on top of other blocks) 
 - more points for dropping off a farther distance away 
   (higher is more important)
